This is one of my first project to deal with which uses an LLM.


The app uses [MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-248M](https://huggingface.co/MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-248M) which is fine-tuned version of [Google/Flan-T5-Base](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base) trained using the LaMini-Instruction Dataset, which is a specialized dataset developed to enhance the performance of small-scale language models like the one being used here!
This trained NLP model has "summarization" pipeline, which I've used to summarize the text contents of each functions extracted using different methods by implementing different python-functions.
Feel free to add changes, correct me and contribute!
